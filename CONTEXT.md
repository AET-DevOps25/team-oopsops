## 1. Main Functionality

> **What is the main functionality ?**

Automatic anonymization and summarization of user-submitted documents - PDFs at first, removing personal data such as names and addresses to ensure compliance with legal and privacy requirements.

Users simply upload a document and can either manually mark sections for redaction or let the AI analyze the text and suggest replacements, ensuring fast, consistent anonymization without leaking any real-world details.

> **Lower Priority:**

Voice based interaction with the documents.

## 3. Integrating Generative AI

> **How do we use GenAI meaningfully?**

1. **Auto-Anonymization**
   - Automatically detect and redact or replace personal/sensitive information.
2. **AI-Powered Summaries**
   - Generate concise summaries to reduce manual reading effort and save users time in reviewing lengthy texts.

### 4.4 Summarization (Optional)
